# Beanfetch
Beanfetch is a very minimal alternative to the famous, but sometimes infamous, [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch).

## OS support
This has only been tested on Arch Linux. In the future, I may start using Docker to test this on various Linux distributions.

## Installation
Run the following commands.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/beanietechie/beanfetch
```

To install to /usr/local/bin, run
```
sudo make install
```

Alternatively, if you want to build without installing, run
```
make
```

## The future of this project
If I feel up to it someday, I may rewrite this in a much faster language.
